# Odin Project Exercise - Landing Page

Hello everyone! This project is an exercise from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which involves creating the game Rock Paper Scissors. The objective of the exercise is to create the game from scratch to practice problem-solving skills. The requirements were:

    - Create a function `getComputerChoice`, `getHumanChoice`
    - Two variables to keep track of the score, `humanScore`/`computerScore` (initializing them to 0)
    - Create the game function `playRound` with two parameters `humanChoice` (must be case insensitive), `computerChoice`
    - The output should be 'You won! Paper beats rock' or 'You lost! Rock beats scissors'
    - Play 5 rounds
    - Write a function `playGame`
    - Move the variables from `playRound` into the new function `playGame`
    - Play 5 rounds by calling `playRound`
    - At the end of the 5 rounds, the output should be 'You won! 5-0' or 'You lost! 2-3'"
The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Exercise 2: In the rps-ui branch, modify the code to support a user-selectable option from a set of three buttons, a game length of five rounds, real-time score updates, a final score display, and a mechanism to reset the game state.
